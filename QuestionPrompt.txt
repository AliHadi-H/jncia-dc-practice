Tagged ( Trunk ) 

Used to allow multiple VLANS 

Usually links to another switch or an edge router 

It can handle traffic for multiple VLANs. Means that it can send and receive data for all the configured VLAN's over the same physical connection. 

Sends the traffic for all configured VLANs over the same physical connection and separates traffic by tagging it with appropriate VLAN ID 

Can carry untagged traffic when configured with the native-vlan-id statement.

Untagged (Access) 

Acepts only a single VLAN: Access ports typically belong to a single VLAN 

Typically connect to end user devices such as laptop , computers, server, and printers 

These ports are usually part of one VLAN and handle untagged Ethernet frames for sending and receiving data. However, there is an exception for the voice VLAN. 

By default, all switch ports are set to access mode and are assigned to the default VLAN when you first get the switch.
